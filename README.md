# Hamdan_Abdulrahman_FIP
This GitHub repo is for a web project called FIP which stands for Final Integrated Project.

In This project, I will be redesigning a website called Couples Resort with a homepage, three mobile pages, and one desktop page. 

 All pages need to use a static CSS Grid for mobile and desktop. Validated HTML and a Document Outline.
