# Couples Resort FIP Project
## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **Final Integrated Project (FIP)**. The objective of this project is to redesign and modernize the web presence of *Couples Resort*. The redesign focuses on creating a high-end, luxury aesthetic while ensuring a robust technical foundation using modern web standards.

The project requires the development of a fully redesigned Homepage, three specific mobile pages, and one desktop page.

## 🎯 Key Objectives & Requirements

This project adheres to strict technical guidelines to ensure code quality and accessibility:

*   **Layout Engine:** All layouts are constructed using **CSS Grid** (Static) to manage complex page structures across mobile and desktop viewports.
*   **Validation:** All code (HTML5 and CSS3) is validated against W3C standards to ensure it is error-free.
*   **Semantics:** A proper **Document Outline** is utilized (H1-H6 hierarchy) to ensure accessibility and SEO best practices.

## 📂 Site Architecture

The project consists of the following key pages:

### 1. Home (`index.html`)
The landing page serves as the introduction to the resort, featuring the main hero imagery, introductory text, and navigation to internal sections.

### 2. Rooms (`rooms.html`)
A mobile-optimized page showcasing the accommodations.
*   **Features:** detailed room descriptions, amenity lists, and photo stacks.
*   **Tech Highlight:** Custom hover animations on image stacks and list items.

### 3. Packages (`packages.html`)
A section dedicated to special offers, honeymoon deals, and seasonal events.
*   **Features:** distinct deal blocks ("Brides", "Musicians", "Planes").
*   **Tech Highlight:** CSS corner-fold effects and hover spotlights on deal cards.

### 4. Reservations (`booknow.html`)
The booking interface where users can check availability.
*   **Features:** Form inputs for dates/guests and detailed policy information.
*   **Tech Highlight:** Input focus states, animated submit buttons, and "signature" underline effects on policy headers.

## 🎨 Design & Interactions

The design aims to evoke a feeling of luxury and relaxation. To achieve this without JavaScript, advanced CSS techniques were employed:

*   **Micro-Interactions:** Subtle hover states using `::after` and `::before` pseudo-elements.
*   **Animations:** Keyframe animations for hero elements (Fade In, Slide Up).
*   **Navigation:** A "Center-Out" strikethrough effect on the navigation menu to mimic high-end editorial design.
*   **Typography:** Use of custom web fonts (`Sanchez` and `Cera GR`) for a distinct brand voice.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
*   **CSS3:** Custom properties, Grid layout, Flexbox, Transitions, and Keyframe Animations.
*   **Font Awesome:** Iconography.
*   **Google Fonts:** Typography.
